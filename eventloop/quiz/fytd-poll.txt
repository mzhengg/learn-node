- In eventloop/poll.js, what will be the order of execution? Briefly explain the order of execution w.r.t the event loop phases.

1. someAsyncOperation() is called, initiating an asynchronous operation to read a file. This operation corresponds to the timers phase, waiting for I/O events.
foo() is called, and it logs 'foo'.
console.log('done') is executed.

2. The event loop enters the poll phase, waiting for I/O events.
The asynchronous file read operation initiated by someAsyncOperation() is ongoing.

3. The file read operation completes, and the callback function is placed in the pending callbacks queue.

4. The event loop moves to the next tick, entering the timers phase.
The callback from the completed file read operation is executed. Depending on the file's content, either 'Data: ...' or 'Read Error' is logged.

5. The event loop continues with the initial execution.
foo() has already been called and logged 'foo'.
console.log('done') has already been executed.
